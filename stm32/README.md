# STM32F103C8T6

Arm Cortex M3, max clock 72MHz, 64KiB flash, 20KiB SRAM. 
**NB** system core clock is **8MHz** by default.

## Arduino IDE

```
Add link:
https://dan.drown.org/stm32duino/package_STM32duino_index.json

In the boards manager search for stm32f1

Uploader:
Generic stm32f103c generic
Upload stlink
```

confirmed working 2020-07-04.

Alternative which does not seem as good:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stm32duino/BoardManagerFiles/master/STM32/package_stm_index.json
```

## Unbricking

If all else fails:

1. Unplug the ST-Link
2. Plug it back in again
3. Hold down the reset button
4. In a CLI, issue the command `st-info --probe`
5. Wait until the command completes
6. Release the reset button


## Unclassified

**2020-07-15** I think I **fried** some of the circuits on the board. Both 3.3V out pins near the STLink connectors seems broken. use the one near the USB port instead. I also suspect some of the SPI pins don't work properly.
